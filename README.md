        -  The main_part.py imports data, checks the data quality and calculates the short term return(breakeven year and daily return rate).
    - whats_next.py. 
       - The whats_next.py supports the analysis in what's next section in the report.



+ documents
    - AirBnB_report.docx
        - AirBnB_report.docx contains three parts:Data quality insight, Visualization insight, and what's next. It documents the process done in main_part.py.
    - appendix.docx
        -  appendix.docx provides charts and plots created in the process and supports some analysis done in AirBnB_report.docx.    
    - 3D_maps.docx
        - 3D_maps.docx contains some geographical plots that are created by excel 3D maps function.   
    - metadata.docx.

+ data
    - Zip_Zhvi_2bedroom.csv
    - listings.csv

    - est_cost.xlsx
    - summary_order.xlsx

+ graphs
    - 
    

I am aware that all the plots should be created directly in my code. All numerical analysis, return calculationa are supported by plots and tables created directly in python. Excel 3D map application only provides better visuliazation effect in whats next section.
