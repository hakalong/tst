# Backgroud
All code are generated in python3.6.5 and in windows 64 system. Packages used are numpy,pandas,matplotlib. There should be 20 files in total.

# Project Organization

+ codes
    - main_part.py
        -  The main_part.py imports data, checks the data quality and calculates the short term return(breakeven year and daily return rate).
    - whats_next.py. 
       - The whats_next.py supports the analysis in what's next section in the report.



+ documents
    - README.md
    - AirBnB_report.docx
        - AirBnB_report.docx contains three parts:Data quality insight, Visualization insight, and what's next. It documents the process done in main_part.py.
    - appendix.docx
        -  appendix.docx provides charts and plots created in the process and supports some analysis done in AirBnB_report.docx.    
    - 3D_maps.docx
        - 3D_maps.docx contains some geographical plots that are created by excel 3D maps function.   
    - metadata.docx. 
        - metadata.docx contains meta data for external dataset and tables created

+ data
    - Zip_Zhvi_2bedroom.csv
    - AirBnB Dataset Link.txt
    - ny_zip.csv
        - Only external data is New York City zip code. To get the New York City zip code list, search New York City in the search bar on page https://www.unitedstateszipcodes.org/.

# Announcement
I am aware that all the plots should be created directly in my code. All numerical analysis, return calculation are supported by plots and tables created directly in python. Excel 3D map application only provides better visuliazation effect in What's Next section.
